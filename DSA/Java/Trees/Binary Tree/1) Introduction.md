# Introduction
A tree is a frequently-used data structure to simulate a hierarchical tree structure.
Each node of the tree will have a root value and a list of references to other nodes which are called child nodes.

A **Binary Tree** is one of the most typical tree structure. As the name suggests, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has **at most two children**, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.

# Types of Trees
### `1. Full Binary Tree`
    A Binary Tree which has either 0 or 2 childrens.
    
### `2. Complete Binary Tree`
    * All levels are completely filled except the last level.
    * The last level has all nodes as left as possible.
    
### `3. Perfect Binary Tree`
    A Binary tree is a Perfect Binary Tree in which all the internal nodes have two children and all leaf nodes are at the same level.
    
### `4. Balanced Binary Tree`
    Tree which contains N number of nodes and has height upto log(N) then it is called Balanced Binary Tree.
    
### `5. Degenerate Tree`
    Tree whose every node has a single children.
