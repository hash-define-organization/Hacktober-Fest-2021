Find nCr for given n and r.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 3, r = 2
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input:
n = 4, r = 2
Output: 6
Your Task:
Complete the function nCrModp() which takes two integers n and r as input parameters and returns the nCr mod 109+7.
Note: nCr does not exist when r > n. Hence, return 0 in that case.

Expected Time Complexity : O(N*R)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

Constraints:
1<= n <= 103
1<= r <= 103
